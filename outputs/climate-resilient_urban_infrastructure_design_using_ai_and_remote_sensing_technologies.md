### 1. Toward Efficient Exploration by Large Language Model Agents
- **Date:** 2025-04-29
- **Source:** arXiv
- **URL:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20997v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20997v1)
- **Abstract:** A burgeoning area within reinforcement learning (RL) is the design of
sequential decision-making agents centered around large language models (LLMs).
While autonomous decision-making agents powered by modern LLMs could facilitate
numerous real-world applications, such successes demand agents that are capable
of data-efficient RL. One key obstacle to achieving data efficiency in RL is
exploration, a challenge that we demonstrate many recent proposals for LLM
agent designs struggle to contend with...

### 2. X-Fusion: Introducing New Modality to Frozen Large Language Models

- **Source:** arXiv
- **URL:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20996v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20996v1)
- **Abstract:** We propose X-Fusion, a framework that extends pretrained Large Language
Models (LLMs) for multimodal tasks while preserving their language
capabilities. X-Fusion employs a dual-tower design with modality-specific
weights, keeping the LLM's parameters frozen while integrating vision-specific
information for both understanding and generation. Our experiments demonstrate
that X-Fusion consistently outperforms alternative architectures on both
image-to-text and text-to-image tasks. We find that inco...

new attack vectors where malicious apps can cause integrity violation of
planning or execution, availability breakdown, or privacy compromise during
execution.
  In this work, we identify new attacks impacting the integrity of planning, as
well as the integrity and avail...

- **Abstract:** Optically active III-V group semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are the leading
element of the upcoming safe quantum communication. However, the entire
electronic and IT infrastructure relies on silicon-based devices, with silicon
also providing a natural platform for photonic integration. Combining
semiconductor optics with silicon electronics is thus a major technological
challenge. This obstacle cannot be directly solved because silicon is optically
inactive. Interfacing III-V quantum dots with...

### 7. Jekyll-and-Hyde Tipping Point in an AI's Behavior
- **Date:** 2025-04-29
- **Source:** arXiv
- **URL:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20980v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20980v1)
- **Abstract:** Trust in AI is undermined by the fact that there is no science that predicts
-- or that can explain to the public -- when an LLM's output (e.g. ChatGPT) is
likely to tip mid-response to become wrong, misleading, irrelevant or
dangerous. With deaths and trauma already being blamed on LLMs, this
uncertainty is even pushing people to treat their 'pet' LLM more politely to
'dissuade' it (or its future Artificial General Intelligence offspring) from
suddenly turning on them. Here we address this acut...

AI-powered smart glasses, and sonar-equipped canes, often face limitations in
real-time obstacle avoidance, precise localization, and adaptability to dynamic
surroundings. To investigate potential solutions, we introduced PathFinder, a
novel map-less navigation system t...

- **Abstract:** This paper presents a novel framework for non-linear equivariant neural
network layers on homogeneous spaces. The seminal work of Cohen et al. on
equivariant $G$-CNNs on homogeneous spaces characterized the representation
theory of such layers in the linear setting, finding that they are given by
convolutions with kernels satisfying so-called steerability constraints.
Motivated by the empirical success of non-linear layers, such as self-attention
or input dependent kernels, we set out to general...

- **Abstract:** Accurate simulation of atomic systems has the potential to revolutionize the
design of molecules and materials. Unfortunately, exact solutions of the
Schr\"odinger equation scale as O(N!) and remain inaccessible for systems with
more than a handful of atoms, forcing scientists to accept steep tradeoffs
between speed and accuracy and limiting the reliability and utility of the
resultant simulations. Recent work in machine learning has demonstrated that
neural network potentials (NNPs) can learn e...
