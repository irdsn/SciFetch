- **Source:** arXiv
- **URL:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20998v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20998v1)
- **Abstract:** Large Multimodal Models (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini, Chameleon) have evolved into
powerful tools with millions of users. However, they remain generic models and
lack personalized knowledge of specific user concepts. Previous work has
explored personalization for text generation, yet it remains unclear how these
methods can be adapted to new modalities, such as image generation. In this
paper, we introduce Yo'Chameleon, the first attempt to study personalization
for large multimodal models. Given 3-5 im...

- **Abstract:** The formation and evolution of ultra-short-period (USP) planets is poorly
understood. However, it is widely thought that these planets migrated inwards
through interactions with outer neighbours. We aimed to confirm and
characterize the USP Earth-sized planet K2-157 b ($P_{\rm orb}$ = 8.8 h). To do
so, We measured 49 radial velocities (RVs) with the ESPRESSO spectrograph and
derived the properties of the system through a RV and transit model. We detect

- **Source:** arXiv
- **URL:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20997v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20997v1)
- **Abstract:** A burgeoning area within reinforcement learning (RL) is the design of
sequential decision-making agents centered around large language models (LLMs).
While autonomous decision-making agents powered by modern LLMs could facilitate
numerous real-world applications, such successes demand agents that are capable
of data-efficient RL. One key obstacle to achieving data efficiency in RL is
exploration, a challenge that we demonstrate many recent proposals for LLM
agent designs struggle to contend with...

Models (LLMs) for multimodal tasks while preserving their language
capabilities. X-Fusion employs a dual-tower design with modality-specific

information for both understanding and generation. Our experiments demonstrate
that X-Fusion consistently outperforms alternative architectures on both
image-to-text and text-to-image tasks. We find that inco...

world models, which predict the dynamic evolution of 3D scenes over time in
response to an embodied agent's actions, providing both spatial and temporal
consistency. We propose to learn a 4D world model by training on RGB-DN (RGB,
Depth, and Normal) videos. This not only surpasses traditional 2D models by
incorporating detailed shape, configuration, and temporal changes into their
predictions, but also allows us to effectiv...

- **Abstract:** We introduce the Hubs and Spokes Learning (HSL) framework, a novel paradigm
for collaborative machine learning that combines the strengths of Federated
Learning (FL) and Decentralized Learning (P2PL). HSL employs a two-tier
communication structure that avoids the single point of failure inherent in FL

performance than ELL, while at significantly lo...

- **Abstract:** We investigate a mechanism for non-ergodic behavior in many-body quantum
systems arising from destructive interference, leading to localization in Fock
space. Drawing parallels with single-particle flat-band localization and
Aharonov-Bohm cages, we identify conditions under which similar interference
effects in the many-body domain produce Fock space cages (FSCs)-highly
localized many-body eigenstates. By interpreting Fock space as a graph where
nodes represent bitstring basis states and edges d...
