## Introduction

**SciFetch** is a Python-based autonomous agent designed to assist researchers in quickly gathering and synthesizing scientific literature.

The project originated from real-world needs to automate topic exploration, reduce manual article screening, and centralize findings in well-formatted outputs.  

It leverages the power of large language models (GPT-4o), planning agents (LangChain), and multiple academic APIs to retrieve high-quality scientific content.

SciFetch aims to provide:

- Fast and structured access to academic knowledge
- Summarized, readable overviews of complex topics
- A foundation for building research tools, assistants, or pipelines

---

## Key Features

- **Multi-source Scientific Retrieval:** Queries across PubMed, arXiv, OpenAlex, EuropePMC, and CrossRef.
- **LangChain Autonomous Agent:** Uses a ReAct-style planner to dynamically select the best tools based on the input prompt.
- **LLM-Powered Summarization:** Synthesizes results into a coherent, human-readable overview using GPT-4o.
- **Markdown Output Generation:** Exports findings to `.md` files, including summaries and lists of relevant articles.
- **Graceful Failure Handling:** Logs errors when a specific API fails but continues processing with other sources.
- **API-Key Secured:** Requires only an OpenAI API key in a `.env` file to run.
- **Internet-Connected Runtime:** Works with real-time API calls to ensure up-to-date academic content.

## Script Overview

| Script / Module                | Description                                                                                                                                  |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `agents/scientific_fetcher.py` | Main agent script that takes a user prompt, queries academic APIs, summarizes findings using GPT-4o, and saves the output to Markdown.       |
| `apis/arXiv.py`                | Interface for querying the arXiv API and extracting metadata. Includes LangChain-compatible tool wrapper.                                    |
| `apis/CrossRef.py`             | Retrieves publication metadata from CrossRef. Cleans and filters fields like DOI, title, abstract, and date.                                 |
| `apis/EuropePMC.py`            | Connects to the Europe PMC API and returns structured article metadata. LangChain-ready.                                                     |
| `apis/OpenAlex.py`             | Queries OpenAlex API and decodes abstracts from inverted index format. Provides unified metadata output.                                     |
| `apis/PubMed.py`               | Uses PubMed's E-utilities to search and fetch publication metadata. Parses XML response into structured JSON.                                |
| `utils/logs_config.py`         | Centralized logging configuration with color-coded output for different log levels.                                                          |

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/SciFetch.git
cd SciFetch
```

2. (Optional but recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Add your OpenAI key on the .env file:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

---

## Usage

To launch the agent, run the script and provide a scientific prompt when requested.

```bash
python agents/scientific_fetcher.py
```

Then enter your prompt interactively, e.g.:

```
Enter your scientific research prompt:
Applications of federated learning in privacy-preserving medical image analysis
```

Generated outputs will be saved to the `outputs/` folder as `.md`.

## Future Work

Although SciFetch is functional and production-ready, there are multiple directions for future enhancements:

- **LLM Self-Evaluation:** Score or rank article relevance based on confidence or alignment with the prompt.
- **PDF Exporting Support:** Add native `.pdf` export alongside Markdown.
- **API Usage Monitoring:** Track rate limits, quota consumption, and retries per tool.
- **Multilingual Summarization:** Enable output generation in multiple languages.
- **Tool Expansion:** Include additional APIs like Semantic Scholar, CORE, or IEEE Xplore.
- **Web Interface:** Provide a lightweight web app (e.g., Streamlit) for broader accessibility.
- **Offline LLM Compatibility:** Explore integration with open-source models (e.g., LLaMA or Mistral) for offline use.
