clustering unlabeled data. A key bottleneck of the $k$-means algorithm is that
each iteration requires time linear in the number of data points, which can be
expensive in big data applications. This was improved in recent works proposing
quantum and quantum-inspired classical algorithms to approximate the $k$-means
algorithm locally, in time depending only logarithmically on the number of data
points (along with data depende...
