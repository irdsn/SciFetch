## Introduction

**SciFetch** is a Python-based autonomous agent designed to assist researchers in quickly gathering and synthesizing scientific literature.

The project originated from real-world needs to automate topic exploration, reduce manual article screening, and centralize findings in well-formatted outputs.  

It leverages the power of large language models (GPT-4o), planning agents (LangChain), and multiple academic APIs to retrieve high-quality scientific content.

SciFetch aims to provide:

- Fast and structured access to academic knowledge
- Summarized, readable overviews of complex topics
- A foundation for building research tools, assistants, or pipelines

---

## Key Features

- Multi-tool querying across PubMed, arXiv, OpenAlex, EuropePMC, and CrossRef
- LangChain agent uses ReAct-style planning with tool selection
- Summarizes findings and highlights relevant articles
- Exports results to Markdown

## Script Overview

| Script / Module                | Description                                                                                                                                    |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `agents/scientific_fetcher.py` | Main agent script that takes a user prompt, queries academic APIs, summarizes findings using GPT-4o, and saves the output to Markdown and PDF. |
| `utils/logs_config.py`         | Centralized logging configuration with info/debug/error levels.                                                                                |

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/SciFetch.git
cd SciFetch
```

2. (Optional but recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Add your OpenAI key on the .env file:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

---

## Usage

To launch the agent, run the script and provide a scientific prompt when requested.

```bash
python agents/scientific_fetcher.py
```

Then enter your prompt interactively, e.g.:

```
Enter your scientific research prompt:
Applications of federated learning in privacy-preserving medical image analysis
```

Generated outputs will be saved to the `outputs/` folder as `.md`.

---

## Important Notes

- The `.env` file is required to run the agent (must include at least the `OPENAI_API_KEY`).
- Internet access is required, as the agent interacts with external APIs and OpenAI services.
- All outputs are saved automatically in the `outputs/` directory in both Markdown and (optionally) PDF format.
- If any API fails during execution, the error will be logged, and the agent will continue processing remaining tools.

---

## Final Words

SciFetch is a small but ambitious project, built to help researchers and engineers accelerate the information gathering process.   
It is an evolving tool, open for experimentation, extension, or integration into larger pipelines or interfaces.
