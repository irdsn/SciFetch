### 11. YoChameleon: Personalized Vision and Language Generation
- **Date:** 2025-04-29
- **Source:** arXiv
- **URL:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20998v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20998v1)
- **Abstract:** Large Multimodal Models (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini, Chameleon) have evolved into
powerful tools with millions of users. However, they remain generic models and
lack personalized knowledge of specific user concepts. Previous work has
explored personalization for text generation, yet it remains unclear how these
methods can be adapted to new modalities, such as image generation. In this
paper, we introduce Yo'Chameleon, the first attempt to study personalization
for large multimodal models. Given 3-5 im...

### 12. Two neighbours to the ultra-short-period Earth-sized planet K2-157 b in

- **Source:** arXiv
- **URL:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20999v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20999v1)
- **Abstract:** The formation and evolution of ultra-short-period (USP) planets is poorly
understood. However, it is widely thought that these planets migrated inwards
through interactions with outer neighbours. We aimed to confirm and
characterize the USP Earth-sized planet K2-157 b ($P_{\rm orb}$ = 8.8 h). To do
so, We measured 49 radial velocities (RVs) with the ESPRESSO spectrograph and
derived the properties of the system through a RV and transit model. We detect
two additional super-Neptune-mass planets w...

### 13. Toward Efficient Exploration by Large Language Model Agents
- **Date:** 2025-04-29
- **Source:** arXiv
- **URL:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20997v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20997v1)
- **Abstract:** A burgeoning area within reinforcement learning (RL) is the design of
sequential decision-making agents centered around large language models (LLMs).
While autonomous decision-making agents powered by modern LLMs could facilitate
numerous real-world applications, such successes demand agents that are capable
of data-efficient RL. One key obstacle to achieving data efficiency in RL is
exploration, a challenge that we demonstrate many recent proposals for LLM
agent designs struggle to contend with...

### 14. X-Fusion: Introducing New Modality to Frozen Large Language Models
- **Date:** 2025-04-29
- **Source:** arXiv
- **URL:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20996v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20996v1)
- **Abstract:** We propose X-Fusion, a framework that extends pretrained Large Language
Models (LLMs) for multimodal tasks while preserving their language
capabilities. X-Fusion employs a dual-tower design with modality-specific
weights, keeping the LLM's parameters frozen while integrating vision-specific
information for both understanding and generation. Our experiments demonstrate
that X-Fusion consistently outperforms alternative architectures on both
image-to-text and text-to-image tasks. We find that inco...

### 15. TesserAct: Learning 4D Embodied World Models
- **Date:** 2025-04-29
- **Source:** arXiv
- **URL:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20995v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20995v1)
- **Abstract:** This paper presents an effective approach for learning novel 4D embodied
world models, which predict the dynamic evolution of 3D scenes over time in
response to an embodied agent's actions, providing both spatial and temporal
consistency. We propose to learn a 4D world model by training on RGB-DN (RGB,
Depth, and Normal) videos. This not only surpasses traditional 2D models by
incorporating detailed shape, configuration, and temporal changes into their
predictions, but also allows us to effectiv...

### 16. Cosmic superstrings in large volume compactifications: PTAs, LISA and
  time-varying tension
- **Date:** 2025-04-29
- **Source:** arXiv
- **URL:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20994v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20994v1)
- **Abstract:** The Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) from cosmic superstrings
offers one of the few known possibilities to test String Theory within current
experimental reach. However, in order to be compatible with the existing
constraints, the tension of a cosmic superstring network is required to lie
several orders of magnitude below the Planck scale. This is naturally realized
in string compactifications where the volume of the extra dimensions is
parametrically large (in string units). We e...

### 17. GDP-GFCF Dynamics Across Global Economies: A Comparative Study of Panel
  Regressions and Random Forest
- **Date:** 2025-04-29
- **Source:** arXiv
- **URL:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20993v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20993v1)
- **Abstract:** This study examines the relationship between GDP growth and Gross Fixed
Capital Formation (GFCF) across developed economies (G7, EU-15, OECD) and
emerging markets (BRICS). We integrate Random Forest machine learning
(non-linear regression) with traditional econometric models (linear regression)
to better capture non-linear interactions in investment analysis. Our findings
reveal that while GDP growth positively influences corporate investment, its
impact varies significantly by region. Developed...

### 18. Constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity from Quaia
- **Date:** 2025-04-29
- **Source:** arXiv
- **URL:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20992v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20992v1)
- **Abstract:** We analyse the large-scale angular clustering of quasars in the Gaia-unWISE
quasar catalog, Quaia, and their cross-correlation with maps of the lensing
convergence of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), to constrain the level of
primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG). Specifically, we target the scale-dependent
bias that would be induced by PNG on biased tracers of the matter
inhomogeneities on large scales. The Quaia sample is particularly well suited
for this analysis, given the large effective v...

### 19. Quantum Hypothesis Testing Lemma for Deterministic Identification over
  Quantum Channels
- **Date:** 2025-04-29
- **Source:** arXiv
- **URL:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20991v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20991v1)
- **Abstract:** In our previous work, we presented the Hypothesis Testing Lemma, a key tool
that establishes sufficient conditions for the existence of good deterministic
identification (DI) codes for memoryless channels with finite output, but
arbitrary input alphabets. In this work, we provide a full quantum analogue of
this lemma, which shows that the existence of a DI code in the quantum setting
follows from a suitable packing in a modified space of output quantum states.
Specifically, we demonstrate that s...

- **Abstract:** Quantum coherent effects can be probed in multilayer graphene through
electronic transport measurements at low temperatures. In particular, bilayer
graphene is known to be susceptible to quantum interference corrections of the
conductivity, presenting weak localization at all electronic densities, and
dependent on different scattering mechanisms as well as on the trigonal warping
of the electron dispersion near the K and K' valleys. Proximity effects with a
molecular thin film influence these sc...
