- **Abstract:** A burgeoning area within reinforcement learning (RL) is the design of
sequential decision-making agents centered around large language models (LLMs).
While autonomous decision-making agents powered by modern LLMs could facilitate
numerous real-world applications, such successes demand agents that are capable
of data-efficient RL. One key obstacle to achieving data efficiency in RL is
exploration, a challenge that we demonstrate many recent proposals for LLM
agent designs struggle to contend with...

- **Abstract:** We analyse the large-scale angular clustering of quasars in the Gaia-unWISE
quasar catalog, Quaia, and their cross-correlation with maps of the lensing
convergence of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), to constrain the level of
primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG). Specifically, we target the scale-dependent
bias that would be induced by PNG on biased tracers of the matter
inhomogeneities on large scales. The Quaia sample is particularly well suited
for this analysis, given the large effective v...

- **Abstract:** The $k$-means algorithm (Lloyd's algorithm) is a widely used method for
clustering unlabeled data. A key bottleneck of the $k$-means algorithm is that
each iteration requires time linear in the number of data points, which can be
expensive in big data applications. This was improved in recent works proposing
quantum and quantum-inspired classical algorithms to approximate the $k$-means
algorithm locally, in time depending only logarithmically on the number of data
points (along with data depende...

- **Source:** arXiv
- **URL:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20978v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20978v1)
- **Abstract:** For a graph $G$, the $k$-coloring graph $\mathcal{C}_{k}(G)$ is obtained by
taking the vertices to be the proper $k$-colorings of $G$ and two $k$-colorings
are incident if they differ exactly on one vertex of $G$. Hogan, Scott,
Tamitegama and Tan recently proved that $\mathcal{C}_{k_1}(G_1)\cong
\mathcal{C}_{k_2}(G_2)$ with $k_1>5n_1^2$ and $k_2>5n_2^2$ implies $G_1\cong
G_2$, where $n_i$ is the number of vertices of $G_i$ for $i=1,2$. We sharpen
this result by showing that $\mathcal{C}_{k_1}(G_...

- **URL:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20968v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20968v1)
- **Abstract:** Recently, Stanley and Grinberg introduced a symmetric function associated to
digraphs, called the Redei-Berge symmetric function. This function, however,
does not satisfy the deletion-contraction property, which is a very powerful
tool for proving various identities using induction. In this paper, we
introduce an analogue of this function in noncommuting variables which does
have such property. Furthermore, it specializes to the ordinary Redei-Berge
function when the variables are allowed to com...
